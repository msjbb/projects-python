# Flashcards




## About
When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data, so if you want to create a useful tool to help your learning and your programming skills, this project is for you.
## Usage

python flashcards.py [-i] [-e] 

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
